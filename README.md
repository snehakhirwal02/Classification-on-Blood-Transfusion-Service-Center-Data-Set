## Random forest classification

Blood donation is an extremely essential contribution that a person may make to society since it not only saves the lives of individuals who need blood, but it is also helpful to donors. People lose blood every day as a result of accidents and injuries and they require fresh blood to compensate for the loss, thus there is a great demand for donors who are willing to donate their blood.

Predicting whether a donor will donate blood in the future can aid in the easy identification of blood donors. As a result, in this project, I will implement machine learning techniques to analyse data from the Blood Transfusion Service Center in Hsin-Chu City, Taiwan. The purpose of this project is to build a model that can predict whether or not the donor will donate in future.

The dataset of this project originates from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Blood+Transfusion+Service+Center).

The approach to this project is organised in the following steps:

### - Exploring and visualizing the data through Exploratory data analysis(EDA)
    This involved exploration of the data (getting statistical knowledge) and also understanding the relationship between 
    the independent variables to draw useful insights and observations.
    
### - Data Cleaning 
    This involved cleaning of the data(removing the missing or invalid NA values) 
    
### - Normalization and feature selection
    The features/ independent variables are scaled and only important features are selected in order to get better 
    accuracy and results.
    
### - Applying classification on the Machine learning model
    It invloved the splitiing of data into train and test data sets. The model is fitted on the training dataset. 
    The model learns gradually with the training data set and later on the efficiency of the model is tested 
    on the test data set.
    
### - Results
    Finally, the metric 'accuracy' is used to test the effeciency of the both the class labels(0 and 1). 
    The classfication report is also obtained.
