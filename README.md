### Blood donation is an extremely essential contribution that a person may make to society since it not only saves the lives of individuals who need blood, but it is also helpful to donors. People lose blood every day as a result of accidents and injuries and they require fresh blood to compensate for the loss, thus there is a great demand for donors who are willing to donate their blood.

### Predicting whether a donor will donate blood in the future can aid in the easy identification of blood donors. As a result, in this project, I will implement machine learning techniques to analyse data from the Blood Transfusion Service Center in Hsin-Chu City, Taiwan. The purpose of this project is to build a model that can predict whether or not the donor will donate in future.
